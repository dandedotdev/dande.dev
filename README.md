# Dande.dev

Hi, I'm Dandelion ðŸŒ¼! My friends usually call me Dande. This is my personal website, built with the [Leptos](https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos) web framework and [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum).

## Why Using Leptos

I've been using [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) and [React](https://github.com/facebook/react) since 2022, before diving into the world of [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust).

I genuinely enjoy Rust's programming philosophy and wanted to incorporate it as much as possible in my work. While I recognize that the JavaScript ecosystem is quite mature, I was determined to build my personal website with Rust.

I spent about a week experimenting with both Leptos and [Dioxus](https://github.com/DioxusLabs/dioxus), and found that Leptos' JSX-like syntax was easier for me to use. That's why I ultimately chose Leptos.

> I also recommended using Dioxus for the front end. A lot of people are contributing to its ecosystem.

## Lighthouse Score

I'd like to express my sincere gratitude to [gbj](https://github.com/gbj) for his guidance and maintenance of Leptos, a framework that demonstrates exceptional performance.

## Acknowledgements

This blog template is highly inspired by [itehax/rust-blog](https://github.com/itehax/rust-blog) and [timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog](https://github.com/timlrx/tailwind-nextjs-starter-blog).

I also learned a lot from [leptos-rs/leptos/examples/static-routing](https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos/tree/main/examples/static_routing) and [this discussion on GitHub](https://github.com/leptos-rs/leptos/discussions/3039).

Later in development, I realized I should compile static posts at build time. [NiklasEi/cinnog_example](https://github.com/NiklasEi/cinnog_example) provided significant inspiration for this approach.

In the early stages of this project, I referenced the layouts of [timlrx/timlrx.com](https://github.com/timlrx/timlrx.com) and [hta218/leohuynh.dev](https://github.com/hta218/leohuynh.dev).
