Hi, welcome to Dande.dev! I'm Dandelion Huang, a frontend engineer specializing in Next.js, React, Rust, and TypeScript, with a particular focus on building high-performance web applications that bridge the gap between Rust's systems programming capabilities and frontend development.

I'm passionate about exploring innovative technologies and creating elegant solutions, particularly in implementing design patterns for scalable and maintainable applications. My current work involves developing Rust-powered web components and contributing to open-source projects to explore the potential of Rust in frontend development.

Driven by my curiosity for diverse experiences and knowledge, I've created this website as a playground to explore and document my findings, ideas, and memories.
